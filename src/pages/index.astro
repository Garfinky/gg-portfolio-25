				<hr />
				<p class="margin-bottom-2">I’m Gareth, I’m a Graphic Designer & Web Designer. In my spare time, I can be found hiking, being a dad, and (when the dad part is done) playing video games. My goal when I wake up each day, is to know more at the end of the day than I did at the start. I love learning, growth and pushing pixels.</p>
